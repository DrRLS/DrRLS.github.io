Identifying such transcription factors by their cell-type-specific expression or their involvement in developmental regulation has had limited success. We hypothesized that because cell type is often resilient to perturbations, the transcriptional response to perturbations would reveal identity-maintaining transcription factors. We developed perturbation panel profiling (P3) as a framework for perturbing cells across many conditions and measuring gene expression responsiveness transcriptome-wide. In human iPSC-derived cardiac myocytes, P3 showed that transcription factors important for cardiac myocyte differentiation and maintenance were among the most frequently upregulated (most responsive). We reasoned that one function of responsive genes may be to maintain cellular identity. We identified responsive transcription factors in fibroblasts using P3 and found that suppressing their expression led to enhanced reprogramming. We propose that responsiveness to perturbations is a property of transcription factors that help maintain cellular identity in~vitro. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.","tags":["cardiac myocytes","cell identity","fibroblasts","gene regulation","induced pluripotent stem cells","reprogramming","systems biology","transdifferentiation"],"title":"Responsiveness to perturbations is a hallmark of transcription factors that maintain cell identity in~vitro","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Alexanian","Pawel F.

Fibroblast activation is a common stress response in tissues that worsens lung, liver, kidney and heart disease, yet its mechanistic basis remains unclear1,2. Pharmacological inhibition of bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins alleviates cardiac dysfunction3–7, providing a tool to interrogate and modulate cardiac cell states as a potential therapeutic approach. Here we use single-cell epigenomic analyses of hearts dynamically exposed to BET inhibitors to reveal a reversible transcriptional switch that underlies the activation of fibroblasts. Resident cardiac fibroblasts demonstrated robust toggling between the quiescent and activated state in a manner directly correlating with BET inhibitor exposure and cardiac function. Single-cell chromatin accessibility revealed previously undescribed DNA elements, the accessibility of which dynamically correlated with cardiac performance. Among the most dynamic elements was an enhancer that regulated the transcription factor MEOX1, which was specifically expressed in activated fibroblasts, occupied putative regulatory elements of a broad fibrotic gene program and was required for TGFβ-induced fibroblast activation. Selective CRISPR inhibition of the single most dynamic cis-element within the enhancer blocked TGFβ-induced Meox1 activation. We identify MEOX1 as a central regulator of fibroblast activation associated with cardiac dysfunction and demonstrate its upregulation after activation of human lung, liver and kidney fibroblasts. The plasticity and specificity of BET-dependent regulation of MEOX1 in tissue fibroblasts provide previously unknown trans- and cis-targets for treating fibrotic disease.","tags":["Genetics","Molecular biology"],"title":"A transcriptional switch governs fibroblast activation in heart disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Parisha P.

Ubiquitously expressed chromatin regulators modulate these networks, yet the mechanisms governing how tissue specificity of their function is achieved are poorly understood. BRD4 (bromodomain-containing protein 4), a member of the BET (bromo- and extraterminal domain) family of ubiquitously expressed acetyl-lysine reader proteins, plays a pivotal role as a coactivator of enhancer signaling across diverse tissue types in both health and disease and has been implicated as a pharmacological target in heart failure. However, the cell-specific role of BRD4 in adult cardiomyocytes remains unknown.Methods:We combined conditional mouse genetics, unbiased transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses, and classic molecular biology and biochemical approaches to understand the mechanism by which BRD4 in adult cardiomyocyte homeostasis.Results:Here, we show that cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Brd4 in adult mice leads to acute deterioration of cardiac contractile function with mutant animals demonstrating a transcriptomic signature characterized by decreased expression of genes critical for mitochondrial energy production. Genome-wide occupancy data show that BRD4 enriches at many downregulated genes (including the master coactivators Ppargc1a, Ppargc1b, and their downstream targets) and preferentially colocalizes with GATA4 (GATA binding protein 4), a lineage-determining cardiac transcription factor not previously implicated in regulation of adult cardiac metabolism. BRD4 and GATA4 form an endogenous complex in cardiomyocytes and interact in a bromodomain-independent manner, revealing a new functional interaction partner for BRD4 that can direct its locus and tissue specificity.Conclusions:These results highlight a novel role for a BRD4-GATA4 module in cooperative regulation of a cardiomyocyte-specific gene program governing bioenergetic homeostasis in the adult heart.","tags":null,"title":"BRD4 (Bromodomain-Containing Protein 4) Interacts with GATA4 (GATA Binding Protein 4) to Govern Mitochondrial Homeostasis in Adult Cardiomyocytes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leela Chakravarti Dilley","Milan Szuperak","Naihua N Gong","Charlette E Williams","Ricardo Linares Saldana","David S Garbe","Mubarak Hussain Syed","Rajan Jain","Matthew S Kayser"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583020800,"objectID":"60c757c9d1853056ba5e2c8aa898be86","permalink":"https://DrRLS.github.io/publication/2020-01-01_identification_of_a_/","publishdate":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-01-01_identification_of_a_/","section":"publication","summary":"Across species, sleep in young animals is critical for normal brain maturation. The molecular determinants of early life sleep remain unknown. Through an RNAi-based screen, we identified a gene, pdm3, required for sleep maturation in Drosophila. Pdm3, a transcription factor, coordinates an early developmental program that prepares the brain to later execute high levels of juvenile adult sleep. PDM3 controls the wiring of wake-promoting dopaminergic (DA) neurites to a sleep-promoting region, and loss of PDM3 prematurely increases DA inhibition of the sleep center, abolishing the juvenile sleep state. RNA-Seq/ChIP-Seq and a subsequent modifier screen reveal that pdm3 represses expression of the synaptogenesis gene Msp300 to establish the appropriate window for DA innervation. These studies define the molecular cues governing sleep behavioral and circuit development, and suggest sleep disorders may be of neurodevelopmental origin.","tags":["central complex","development","dopamine","ontogeny","sleep","synapse"],"title":"Identification of a molecular basis for the juvenile sleep state","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haig Aghajanian","Toru Kimura","Joel G.

The gas-exchange niche in the lung contains two major epithelial cell types, alveolar type 1 (AT1) and AT2 cells, and the timing of lineage specification of these cells is critical for the correct formation of this niche and postnatal survival. Integrating cell-specific lineage tracing studies, spatially specific mRNA transcript and protein expression, and single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis, we demonstrate that specification of alveolar epithelial cell fate begins concomitantly with the proximal–distal specification of epithelial progenitors and branching morphogenesis earlier than previously appreciated. By using a newly developed dual-lineage tracing system, we show that bipotent alveolar cells that give rise to AT1 and AT2 cells are a minor contributor to the alveolar epithelial population. Furthermore, single-cell assessment of the transcriptome identifies specified AT1 and AT2 progenitors rather than bipotent cells during sacculation. These data reveal a paradigm of organ formation whereby lineage specification occurs during the nascent stages of development coincident with broad tissue-patterning processes, including axial patterning of the endoderm and branching morphogenesis.","tags":["alveolar epithelium","lineage fate","lung development","single-cell RNA sequencing"],"title":"Early lineage specification defines alveolar epithelial ontogeny in the murine lung","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ricardo Linares Saldana"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

In most species, centromeres are epigenetically defined by the presence of a histone H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A), independent of underlying DNA sequence. Therefore, centromere inheritance depends on maintaining the CENP-A nucleosome mark across generations. Experiments in cycling somatic cells have led to a model in which centromere identity is maintained by a cell cycle-coupled CENP-A chromatin assembly pathway. However, the processes of animal gametogenesis pose unique challenges to centromere inheritance because of the extended cell cycle arrest and the massive genome reorganization in the female and male germline, respectively. Here, we review our current understanding of germline centromere inheritance and highlight outstanding questions.","tags":["CENP-A","Centromere","Germline","Inheritance"],"title":"Centromere inheritance through the germline","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

How recycling tubules are formed remains unknown. We show that recycling endosome biogenesis requires the protein complex BLOC-1. Mutations in BLOC-1 subunits underlie an inherited disorder characterized by albinism, the Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome, and are associated with schizophrenia risk. We show here that BLOC-1 coordinates the kinesin KIF13A-dependent pulling of endosomal tubules along microtubules to the Annexin A2/actin-dependent stabilization and detachment of recycling tubules. These components cooperate to extend, stabilize and form tubular endosomal carriers that function in cargo recycling and in the biogenesis of pigment granules in melanocytic cells. By shaping recycling endosomal tubules, our data reveal that dysfunction~of the BLOC-1-KIF13A-Annexin A2 molecular network underlies the pathophysiology of neurological and pigmentary disorders.","tags":null,"title":"BLOC-1 Brings Together the Actin and Microtubule Cytoskeletons to Generate Recycling Endosomes","type":"publication"}]
